Subject: [PATCH] hostapd: fix bandwidth downgrade in DFS case

Currently when DFS interference is detected and no available
channel definition is found, it tries to reduce the bandwidth
one by one to find the next available chandef.

During 320 MHz operation, as per the enum definition, next bandwidth
is not 160 MHz which leads to selecting some wrong bandwidth config
and hence bandwidth is reduced drastically and at times it leads to wrong
chandef calculation.

Fix this issue by selecting 160 MHz when current bandwidth is 320 MHz.
From 160 MHz, all other bandwidth are continous.
