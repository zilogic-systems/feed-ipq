Subject: [PATCH 2/2] hostapd: select channel based on hw_idx during single
 wiphy operation

Currently, channel is selected from the current hw_mode. However, not
all channels under current hw_mode might be available for the current
operating underlying hardware.

Commit "hostapd: add support to use underlying hw_idx for multi-hardware under
single phy mode" added support to store the possible underlying hardware info
and set the current operating hardware index.

Add logic to check if the selected channel falls under the current operating
hardware index and only if it falls then continues with the channel.
