Subject: [PATCH] hostapd: Set last octet of country string field to 0x04

In beacon frames, the last octet of the country string field in the
country IE is currently advertising a value of 0x20. However,
according to the WFA Agile Multiband Tech Spec, it should be set to
a value of 0x04. This adjustment is currently made only if the current
operating opclass is a 6 GHz opclass.

Hence set the last octet of the country string to 0x4, irrespective of the
current operating opclass.
