Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: optimize dp tx limit threshold

The current global dp tx limit threshold is 49152 and pdev dp tx limit
threshold is 32768. This means that there can be up to 49152 dp skbs
for which tx completion has to be received from hardware.
Higher the number of pending tx skbs, higher the memory consumption
during traffic run. Reduce the memory consumption of the driver
module during traffic run by optimizing the dp tx limit threshold.

The reduced optimum value of global dp tx limit threshold and pdev dp
tx limit threshold are 32000 and 24000. With these values, the
throughput doesn't get affected.

The pdev dp tx limit threshold does not track ATH12K_NUM_POOL_TX_DESC
anymore. There is no direct relation between optimum pdev tx limit
threshold and ATH12K_NUM_POOL_TX_DESC.
