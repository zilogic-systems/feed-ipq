Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: Ignore duplicate status cb received from MHI

FW sending two different interrupt (ex: state change and Execution
Environment(EE) change) for RDDM and MHI trigger status callback two times.
In ATH layer second callbacks interpreted as FW crash during the recovery hence
driver triggering BUG_ON.

Driver ignoring the duplicate event received from MHI based on the
current and privious EE value for RDDM callback because both RDDM callback has
same EE.
