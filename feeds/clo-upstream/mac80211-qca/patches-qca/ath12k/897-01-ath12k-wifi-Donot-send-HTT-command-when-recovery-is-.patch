Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ath12k: wifi: Donot send HTT command when recovery is in
 progress

Skip sending HTT command to invalidate FSE cache when recovery is
in progress. This is required for mode1 recovery where one radio
can recover without affecting the operation of other radios.

When recovery is happening on one radio, update the rules only on other
radios which are active. Once recovery is completed, Invalidate the full
cache so that the radio which was under recovery gets updated with the
latest set of FSE rules.
