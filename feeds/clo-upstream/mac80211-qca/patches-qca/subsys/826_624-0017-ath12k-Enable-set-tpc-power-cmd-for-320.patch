Subject: [PATCH] ath12k: enable sending TPC power command for 320 MHz

TPE spec is not yet defined for 320 MHz. However, for proper
Tx power related calculations, it is mandatory to send SET_TPC_POWER
command to firmware in 320 MHz as well.

Add support to form and send the TPC power command for 320 MHz bandwidth
as well.
