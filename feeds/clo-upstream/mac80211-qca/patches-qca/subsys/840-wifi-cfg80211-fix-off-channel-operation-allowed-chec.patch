Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: fix off channel operation allowed check for
 MLO

Currently, in off channel operation allowed check, if any link in the
interface operates on a RADAR channel, the check returns false under
the assumption that RADAR channel can not be left for off channel
scanning. But this assumption is true only for non-MLO case.

This is because, with MLO, there could be multiple links associated
with the interface and scan could happen in other underlying HW. Hence,
it can do a off channel scan.

Add fix to check if there is a requested channel on the HW which already
operate on the RADAR channel, and if so then return false for the off
channel operation check or else true.
