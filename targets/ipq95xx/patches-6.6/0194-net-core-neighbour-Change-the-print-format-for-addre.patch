Subject: [PATCH 093/500] net: core: neighbour: Change the print format for
 addresses

Print format %p displays the kernel address while bypassing the
kptr_restrict sysctl settings.

Change the print format for addresses from %p to %pK. If
kptr_restrict is enabled, addresses are printed as zeroes. To view
the actual addresses, disable kptr_restrict by -
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict

This patch applies the vollowing change from kernel/msm-3.18:
ee833ce586 (net: core: neighbour: Change the print format for addresses)
