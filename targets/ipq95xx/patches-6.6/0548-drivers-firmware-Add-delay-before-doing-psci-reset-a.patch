Subject: [PATCH] drivers: firmware: Add delay before doing psci reset and
 poweroff

Adding delay to ensure all the uart buffer contents
are pushed to console before reset, poweroff or halt.

Cherry-pick of the below 2 commits:
32f8d4880226 ("drivers: firmware: Add 100 ms delay before doing psci reset")
568870ef8c8b ("drivers: firmware: Add 10 ms delay before doing psci poweroff")
